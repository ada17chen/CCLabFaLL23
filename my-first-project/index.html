                <p>In a hidden pond within the Creative Coding Lab Biodiversity Atlas, an extraordinary rare egg called Ducktron was captured to a secret science lab. It then hatched as part of an experiment involving a mysterious virus. This virus caused Ducktron to grow and mutate rapidly, resulting in its peculiar shape and abilities. This duck became duckymama as she began to hatch many other ducklings that looks a bit deformed. However, worry not, they become just like duckymama after one day as they grow rapidly.  With its sharp beaks, they consume dusts and mosquitoes. 
    They are currently in a trapped space in the sky as we can examine them. Duckymama’s exceptional abilities included swift and agile movements, even hovering in the air. When irritated, she will become upset and rotate its head. Its unique beak and rapid movements helps it evade predators. Because the ducklings are still young, they won’t be as strong. Hence, they will run away.</p>
